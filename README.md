# Q-Learning-Implementation-on-FPGA
The primary objective of this project was to enhance the reliability of 5G mobile networks by accelerating the Q-learning algorithm used for self-healing mechanisms. Self-healing is a crucial feature in 5G networks, allowing the system to automatically detect and recover from faults, ensuring uninterrupted service.
